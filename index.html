                               <p>There's a lot to do in Ubisoft's latest release <a class="first" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/"><em>Assasin's Creed-Odyssey</em></a>.Ubisoft wasn't joking around
                               when it called the release an Odyssey.It's not just in the Greek tragedy-inspired story, the vast, vast map or the sheer number of hours you're going to sink into it. It's the journey. The journey from one Greek island to another, with dolphins and whales cresting the waves alongside your boat. It's about the journey across the stunning Grecian landscape, ranging from forests bearing autumnal hues, to the majestic white marble buildings nestled comfortably in the cities, and absolutely everything in between. Including an active volcano that you can swan dive into. But more importantly, it's also about the journey to discover who exactly you are in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p>

     	<h2>Top-seven things you need to know in Assasin's Creed-Odyssey</h2>

     </div>

        <img class="mid-image-one"src="images/image1.png"> 

     	<h3 class="heading">1. Regularly upgrade, swap out, and engrave your armor</h3>

     	<img class="image-one"src="images/image2.png">

     	<p class="para">When you first start off in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, you’ll probably find yourself with some ordinary grey armor. Give it some time, and there’s a chance that you’ll find yourself with a Legendary (gold) piece of equipment by level 10, and you’ll definitely have come across a Epic (purple) bit of gear. The armor and weapons system works a bit like <a class="first" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-review/"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>: you should swap out anything of a higher level, damage rating, or armor rating than you currently have equipped, but there are a few exceptions.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">2. Dismantle armor and weapons you’re not using so you can upgrade items quickly</h3>

     	<img class="image-two"src="images/image3.png">

     	<p class="para">Don’t be afraid to dismantle your armour. Yes, you won’t get any drachmae for it, but you will get resources, which alter in rarity depending on how powerful the item you’re dismantling is. It can be a bit of a bother running around the world hunting wolves and deer to find leather, or trying to spot chunks of iron in the ground - plus buying them from the blacksmith will cost you a pretty penny - so dismantling items really is a timesaver. Those resources are then at your disposal, so you can use them to upgrade weapons and armour. If you feel your heart rate increase at the thought of destroying armor, you can always choose to dismantle only the items that aren’t worth a lot and you’ll still be swimming around in a giant vault of drachmae like Scrooge McDuck.</p>

     	<h3 class="heading">3. Perfect parrying as soon as you can</h3>

     	<img class="image-three"src="images/image4.png">

         <p class="para">Trust me on this: parrying is super important. Especially in conquest battles. Tapping L1 and R1 simultaneously just when an enemy is about to hit you allows you to parry and, on a successful hit, makes everything apart from you go into slo-mo so you can get in a handful of attacks before the enemy recovers. It’s tempting to just dodge attacks, but that’s not always reliable and isn’t a guarantee that you’ll completely escape the attack (as we found out the hard way). During conquest fights most of the time you’ll find yourself facing two or more enemies at once, and it really helps you prevent becoming overwhelmed if you’re a dab hand at parrying. Consider yourself warned. </p>

         <h3 class="heading">4. Exploration Mode is pretty easy to use</h3>

         <img class="image-four"src="images/image5.png">

         <p class="para">When you first boot up Odyssey, you’ll be asked whether you want to play using Guided mode or Exploration mode. At first exploration mode sounds hardcore, and I definitely imagined a UI-less world with no indication where you should be going or quest prompts, but that’s really not the case. Exploration mode doesn’t have a waypoint telling you where to go, true, but as long as you get all the information you can out of the NPC in question you’ll get clues in the upper-left hand corner of your screen as to where you’re supposed to be heading and what you’re supposed to be doing. All that’s left for you to do is use your noggin to figure out where in each region you should head towards. Once you get close to your target you’ll be prompted to send out Ikaros to scout ahead, which means you’re in the right place.</p>

         <h3 class="heading">5. Some side missions will disappear if you don’t pick them up </h3>

         <img class="image-five"src="images/image6.png">

         <p class="para">As well as there being timed missions which will disappear after 10ish hours on average (you’ll know them by the hourglass next to the mission title), there are also side quests that don’t have an hourglass that are linked to main missions. Miss them, and they’re gone for good. There’s no way to tell which ones will disappear and which won’t, but they’re either loosely linked to the main story or have consequences which will affect the rest of the story...but the only way to tell if they have consequences is to complete them. Yes, I know that doesn’t really help. Apologies.</p>

         <h3 class="heading">6. Don’t kill every mercenary or Leader you find - recruit them instead</h3>

         <img class="image-six"src="images/image7.png">

         <p class="para">It might be tempting to stick your implement of choice into the neck of any mercenaries or leaders that you come across, but every now and again it’s a good idea to try to resist the urge. If you simply get them down to almost no health then knock them out using the Spartan kick (which deals non-lethal damage), you can then recruit them by holding down ALT when you’re near them. That means they’re able to join your ship as Lieutenants, which gives your vessel special perks when you’re out on the waves (such as increased ship health, faster rower stamina regeneration, that kind of thing). Get bored of them and you can always dismiss them, but it’s good to have the option, right? Even if they did once want to paint the streets with your blood...</p>

         <h3 class="heading">7. Buy the Second Wind ability as soon as possible</h3>

         <img class="image-seven"src="images/image8.png">

         <p class="para">Even if you stick to the shadows for most of your playthrough and very rarely find yourself at the end of spear, you’re going to want to Second Wind ability. Why? One word: conquests. During those massive battles you’re unable to hide and/or assassinate enemies, so you’ll have to rely on your warrior weapons to dispatch your foes. Suffer too many hits when you’re used to hiding in the undergrowth and you’ll find yourself having to do the same conquest battle over and over again. To save yourself some grief, buy the Second Wind ability in the warrior tree as soon as you can, which lets you regenerate 25% of your health. It’s worth it for conquests alone, and is the difference between a victory for your side and you throwing your controller across the room because you got desynchronised yet again.
